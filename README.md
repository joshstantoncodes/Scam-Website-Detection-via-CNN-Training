As developer tools are increasingly available for any person to pick up and learn programming, a double edged sword becomes more of a problem with some developers using their skills to deceive and steal data or money from users. Bad actors are becoming more deceptive, likewise fraudulent websites and their corresponding scams are reaching levels of mimicry to legitimate websites that makes recognizing them all the more challenging. An interesting means to combat this is using artificial intelligence via deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This model will incorporate computer vision using the OpenCV Python library which includes various algorithms for image analysis that allow for feature detection, thereby providing materials to train the neural network.
